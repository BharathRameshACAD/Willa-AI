// disclosure.compact
// Skeleton Compact contract to accept/verify selective disclosure proofs (ZK proof metadata).
//
// Intended behavior:
// - Verifier requests a predicate (e.g., age >= 18).
// - User submits a client-generated ZK proof along with a disclosureID.
// - Contract verifies proof metadata and records a disclosure event linking to a consent commitment.
//
// Replace with real Compact code and ZK verification primitives provided by Midnight.
